light. water. seeing. electronics. 
used to run things electrocute shock light 
thomas edison light bulb is more efficient 
comes from the flow of electrons there is alternating current electricity and direct current electricity costs money should be conserved 
shock light connections switch coal wind sun positive negative 
energy from static in the atmosphere. 
lights 

used by lamps electronics phone chargers medical equipment; is dangerous is powerful is useful. 
used everyday found in houses charges things lights rooms never ending supply 
used to provide light raw energy 
light bulb computers chargers amish people don't have it it's important to everyday life as we know it it's how things work generators days without electricity suck 


powerful deathly light colorful backbone of industrialization 
power lighting current 
industrial einstein light power plant air conditioning generator wind turbine electric cars electric fencing 
benjamin franklin used to watch tv do hair cook food make warmth necessary for light 
used to power electronic devices comes from outlet cannot be seen can be deadly associated with lightning 
wires thomas edison lights tv electronics mandatory ubiquitous 
includes lights heating air conditioning something that is installed in most buildings or structures that people work/live in. 
a current that when captured or created can be used to make light and creates power for many appliances 
creates light invented by man static cost money creates energy hung on polls 
conducts power light internet 
used to power things produced by wind turbines water wheels solar panels can shock things lightening is electricity can be conducted and insulated 
the force of energy that comes from static lightning and is used to power nearly all house appliances an unlimited source of energy. 
very useful used everywhere used to make lights appliances and such work hurts when touched by the naked hand electric fencing is used to keep something in or out of a yard or property 
hurts burn bright fast expensive in houses buildings dark without it movies television lights death house microwave wave lengths 
powers many things such as lights stove microwave computers tv's anything that needs to be plugged into an electrical socket 
invented by benjamin franklin energy source used most often power light can be dangerous (especially when combined with water) to the point of causing death produce painful burns if exposed to the skin 
discovered by ben franking saves us a lot of time powers life 
provides power to objects can be dangerous 
movement of electrons powers houses and businesses 
ben franklin lightning black outs the light bulb 

power has a current voltage wattage used to power electronics light bulbs and some cars occurs naturally and man made 
thomas edison light bulb electric current electrons ions science 

benjamin franklin light fires wire 
gives light gives power costs hard to live without 
is a dangerous charge hates water comes in lightning very helpful and convenient great invention generated dangerous represented as yellow or orange fast. 
runs through wires powers lights and other appliances can be dangerous is made up of many parts; current for example measured in volts measured in watts 
a charge or current helps make light power 
danger power television internet light bulbs energy power plant wind power solar power nuclear power 
gives power involves wires electricians deal with electricity used for powered objects expensive 
house bill lights appliances plug outlets 
spark ben franklin and his kite experiment light bulb wire 
light energy heat air-conditioning batteries necessary for technology used for cooking 

powered by water oil or the sun provides lighting and heat energy kinetic energy power 
lights powers homes generator lightning energy plug-in travels through circuits 
shocking not used by amish people energy produces light produces heat produces power for machines and such was discovered by ben franklin 
energy gives light possesses current 
helps light up the room and helps use technology 

used to light up our world can hurt 
travels through lines makes this computer possible makes all lights and everything possible dangerous can cause electrocution and electrical fires makes electric bills. 
a form of power utilized as energy lights things makes things start and stop may hurt someone if used improperly used by people with money not used by lower class people in poverty stricken countries not used by certain farmers 
electric charge electric current the science of dealing with electrical charges produces light requires wires 
power 
light bulb thomas edison essential to today's lifestyle powers almost everything we use is beginning to power cars 
sparks power energy current connection light 
have electron currents 
used to make things work power plants in wires electric shock can't really see it natural electricity like lightening electricians have to pay for it 

gives us light you cant see it is helpful and necessary

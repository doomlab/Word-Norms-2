moving forward can't stop 
the principal of physics which says a body in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force pushing fast powerful. 
inertia: the tendency of matter to occupy the same place at the same time; a ball sitting on a table is said to have inertia because it is not moving but if i knock the ball off the table with my hand and it falls to the floor it now has inertia because it is not stationary; inertia is often a term for laziness as i am sitting here watching television for so long that i have inertia and don't feel like getting up and cooking dinner 
force 
movement scientific principle used in physics 
not able to move 
body at rest body in motion 
forced gathered over time as an object moves a force which is measured in physics. 
the notion that something continues doing what it is currently doing. see newton's laws for more. 
move forward 
uncharged inactive do nothing. 
apathy deadness drowsiness 
movement energy 
having no movement resistance to change people can feel inert objects can be inert 
stored energy 
inactivity lack of motion part of the laws of physics 
sloth sluggishness stillness stupor torpidity torpor

motion static movement 
resistance fatality sparks physics high speed cars 
a force of gravity 
resisting force force that causes something to not move a reluctance 
a moving body tends to stay moving and body at rest tends to stay at rest. difficulty in changing coarse 
resistance of an object 
property of matter tendency for mass to stay in the same position or maintain speed physics newton's laws 
relaxing 
movement the motion that accumulates as it keeps going 
lack of energy sleepiness tiredness 
being in motion or at rest physics 
a tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged

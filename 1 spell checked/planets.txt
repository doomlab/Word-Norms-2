masses that fly through space in orbit of the sun round spherical large mostly uninhabitable

round a lot never seen weird scary space 
terrestrial extra terrestrial aliens outer space large round 
orbiting bodies in the solar system suns moons they can have craters and storms most are lifeless orbit the sun 
found in solar systems. pluto venus earth mars million and billions are found in space. un measurable in quantity. large simi round objects. gravity holds them in place. some are hot and cold. 
is a classification of space masses are far away are the final frontier. 
space solar system earth 
they are big usually round orbit the sun earth float in space 
mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune in space 
massive space questions about them aliens life numbers keep changing. 
used to raise life used to serve purpose makes up the universe can be destroyed by those who inhabit it is what the earth is home of many different living organisms 
there are nine of them we live on one of them they revolve around the sun they have their own orbits found in outer space they all have different temperatures and forms of life 
out space aliens rocket ship stars gas nasa earth 
pluto orbit gravity unknown aliens cold hot space earth earth center of universe 
was nine now eight large spheres some have rings have moons have gravity and rotate around the sun 
nine big earth mars sun moon outer space stars galaxy small more keep being discovered grade school science 
located in the solar system there was 8 different planets but now there's 7 pluto is not one anymore earth mars jupiter mercury spain uranus neptune venus 
round unlivable conditions huge in size far away rotate around the sun located in space possible aliens different conditions on each one related to science possibly made by the concept of the big bang theory 
earth they make up our solar system made of rock or ice or gas one live able others not floats in space revolves around the sun

earth 
mystery distant unable to survive on them except one chunks of what was once one large mass orbiting strange amazing very distant science 
very far away but also very close if you're talking about earth a club pluto no longer belongs to (now part of the sub-sect of the dwarfs) hostile except for earth nasa is trying to go to mars able to be seen through a telescope make the universe quite mystical 
are celestial bodies composed of rock/gas composed of various elements orbit stars exist in systems systems exist in galaxies 
is an object in space smaller than a star but larger than an asteroid 
round ever changing colorfully some times have rings around them. 
in the solar system earth is in the category could be forms of life on them there are 9 of them and they are all different shapes and sizes

are in the sky part of the solar system orbit around a star eight in our solar system earth jupiter mars venus neptune saturn mercury uranus. seen with telescope. 
universe saturn mercury uranus mars venus earth pluto 
found in outer space beyond earth astronomy a similar body revolving about a star other than the sun heat pressure gravity 
big balls of mass that have a pattern in which they orbit around a sun inside of a galaxy. 
all look differently; many unknown aspects about them; we have like eight or nine in our galaxy; planet earth contains life 
are round far away from earth different shapes different colors have aliens only spaceships and rockets can reach them

green grow by sun and water 
solar system moons earth water land 
large bodies in space consisting of large amounts of gases and solid materials contained within an atmosphere 
green have leafs produce oxygen landscape flowers 
the solar systemmany orbiting orbs 
apart of the universe pluto has been ruled out as being a planet now there eight known planets move through gravity some made of gases others made of solids revolve around sun 
part of the universe part of our solar system house life complex barren hard to reach diverse undiscovered round cold hot in space have gravity enormous small have moons 
out of space universe saturn globe jupiter mars world pluto stars rockets. 
star globe pluto mercury world jupiter mars earth venus saturn 
there were 9 when i was in elementary and now there are 8 pluto is no longer one of them jupiter is the biggest have many moons but some only have one only earth is inhabitable think life was on mars collectively create our solar system

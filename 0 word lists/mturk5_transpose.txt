Boring	"After reading some people's  posts here it made me wonder what exactly do you consider to be a boring person?  I've never been bored by anyone; I tend to find everyone interesting in some way. However, my EX used to sit and watch TV from the time he came home from work until time to go to sleep (stripping in front of the TV just got me yelled at, and it wasn't during a sports game, so believe me I tried everything lol). Did I consider him boring? No. I considered him lazy. Later on he admitted he was just too lazy.   So what is boring? Empty headed people that ramble on about nothing? Those who have nothing interesting to say? Or for you, is it people that aren't active enough? Do you need to constantly be doing something? Is it all about action?  I used to be very athletic, played softball, trained horses, rode a lot, had motorcycle meetups with friends, etc...... but now that I'm less active, I still view people the same and don't really find them boring. So I'm curious about how others feel."

Tight	close,together,stylish
Tight	not losse, fit, close
Tight	rigid
Tight	Tight is used as an adverb following verbs that denote a process of closure or constriction, as squeeze, shut, close, tie, and hold. In this use it is subtly distinct from the adverb tightly. Tight denotes the state resulting from the process, whereas tightly denotes the manner of its application. As such, tight is more appropriate when the focus is on a state that endures for some time after the activity has ended. The sentence She closed up the house tight suggests preparation for an impending blizzard. By the same token, it is more natural to say The windows were frozen tight than The windows were frozen tightly, since in this case the tightness of the seal is not likely to be the result of the manner in which the windows were frozen. With a few verbs tight is used idiomatically as an intensive and is the only possible form: sleep tight; sit tight.

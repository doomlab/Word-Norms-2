the force that holds the earth together without gravitational pull we would all go spinning into space because of gravity i can only jump just so high 
what holds us to the earth important in physics an situation that has importance 
the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth or toward any other physical body having mass. for most purposes newton's laws of gravity apply with minor modifications to take the general theory of relativity into account

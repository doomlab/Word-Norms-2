to head with a current to go north 
in a creek or river the direction the water is flowing from

river water going up front 
salmon current fisherman

moving in the opposite direction as a river or creek 
up somewhere 
moving against the flow more difficult path 
related to two points along a moving body of water opposite of downstream closer to a river/stream's source than the object being discussed 
at the top of the river brook or stream at the beginning at the top of a water area. 
to move against the flow of a river uphill directed upstream situated upstream 
what you use to describe a location further along a river or stream indicating that a task or goal is hard to accomplish 
moving or situated in the opposite direction from that in which a stream or river flows; nearer to the source

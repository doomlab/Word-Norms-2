breathe nitrogen oxygen gases space radio waves sound waves circulation 
all around us made up of many gases necessary for life none in vacuum is not solid is breathed can be polluted 


oxgyen what we breath healthy 
what we breath but in tires balls in the atmosohere 
air: weightless thin dirty clean cold hot. 

oxygen breathe cold 
invisible object that we breathe oxygen 
part of our atmoshere 
can be used to breathe can't live without it can be polluted usually clear and unseen and nonscented can hold poisonous gasses always surrounds you 
is an object used to breathe 
oxygen and other elements substance we breath in 
we need air to breathe and to live 
is what you breathe 
light oxygen invisible 
is something require for living part of the environment is one of four traditionally called "elements" 
the substance that humans breath andis a mixture of nitrogen oxygen and minute amounts of other gases that surrounds the earth and forms its atmosphere.  
we breathe it made from trees all over 

cant see it cant smell it need it to survive 
oxygen wind the space around people intangible. 
is vital to life has no smell or color is not visible can be hot or cold is made of many different chemicals. 
has weight can be compressed feeds life is found in the atmosphere usually has no sent or taste can be hot or cold we control it in our houses can't control it in nature 

air conditioning cooling sensation wind colorless odorless tasteless 
clear breath short of breath 
breathing oxygen nessicary free polluted 
is an combination of elements is all around is heavier than helium 
white blown cold hot balloon 
clean oxygen pollution. 
clear 78% nitrogen important for every life form breathable becoming polluted smoke contains oxygen oxygen is needed for body to function 
air: is what you breath is all around you can not be seen is necessary for life heated air is lighter than cold air different temperatures of air masses creates storms. 
is what we breathe we breathe in oxygen while plants take in carbon dioxide 
the sky above.the collective name for particles with breathe in and the particles that fill the earths atmosphere. 
need to breath can be turned on to cool a house or a car can be dirty can be cleaned it is controlled put it in tires can be toxic associated with things that fly such ass air plains or hot air balloons 
is oxygen is needed to live can be cold or warm 
clear all around us vital for life a good insulator 
multiple gasesbreathed in and outfresh 
is what mammals breathe fills the sky is light weight 
we breathe it it keeps us living our lungs turn it into energy 
what we breath in to get oxygen feel air in the form of wind surrounds us all the time many elements in the air can be air pollution 
the stuff we breath oxygen air conditioner keeps you cold fly in it 
clear good for the body oxygen everywhere not in space 
what we breathe 
air: the thing we breathe something that gives us life something found on earth maybe even other planets. a required thing for the human and animal population. 
can't be seen something we breath clean polluted 

what is breathed on earth contains oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide can refer to balloons planes fly through it birds fly through it we can't see it but we know it's there giver of life it is polluted 
made of nitrogen oxygen and argon necessary for human life and animals in the ozone 
all around us. oxygen. breathable. nothing. light. "catching air." 
necessary for life breath breathe oxygen o2 pollution carbon monoxide carbon dioxide 

is all around us is what we breathe is invisible 

we breath it it is colorless it is essential to life can sometimes carry smells is a mixture of many different gases takes up all the space around us can become polluted and/or toxic is inhaled by our lungs can be felt as it is blown by the wind 
oxygen outside breathed in necessary for life 
everything surrounding matter 
is what we breathe couldn't live without it has no color or oddor oxygen comes from plants 
needed to surviveall around uscan be cold/hotcan be pollutedis importantinvisiblevital for breathing 

what we breath very low density can be cold and hot 
what surrounds all life. 
you can't see it transparent humans breath it is made of elements fills a balloon is a gas 

you breathe it it gives life it is invisible it is invaluavble 
necessity thin wet to breathe clean can be dirty lots of it clear always around absorbed by the lungs keep you alive oxygenate blood body function 


open space what we put in tires to keep them inflated blaloons are usually inflated with air 
what you breathe keeps you alive invisible 
breathe necessary to live 
particles filled with germs dust in the air breathing fresh cold hot wind blowing 
what you breath need for balloons what surrounds you 
a mixture of different elements as gases commonly refereed to as oxygen and carbon dioxide. i found anywhere. generally clear 
what we breath in oxygennecessary to survive 
surrounds us daily need it to live breathe it 
element oxygen breathed byproduct from trees pure clean smog o2 fresh breeze wind 
you breathe it can be polluted or clean 
air 
air: breathe 
atoms and molecules pollution breathing essence of life forceful disastrous tornado carries things 
oxygen carbon dioxide needed for survival dirty and polluted ozone layer 
is essential for breathing is a all around is in the sky goes with plane 
necessity breathe lungs lots of it to sustain life mouth clear can be cold can be warm can have humidity 
what we breath gas made mainly of nitrogen contains oxygen and carbon dioxide 
what surrounds the earth what we breathe 
made of oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide and others can get polluted required for survival 
what we breath 
needed for survival dirty cool hot oxygen 
is breathed is made of particles is made of elements is used by lungs is necessary for human life contains oxygen contains nitrogen 
is everything in the room the sky the atmosphere air has carbon dioxide and oxygen as well as other elements you can not see air most of the time all kinds of smells can be in the air it is used to breath 
breathe cold hot warm wind 

weightless colorless everywhere important 
clear breath tire balloon 


something to breath a clear substance that populates the air contains oxygen which is vital to the functioning of the human body as well as plants and animals a mixture of oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen amoung others 

breathe pollute energy thin humid 
invisible can be cold can be hot always moving made of small molecules what everything breathes promotes life makes the atmosphere what separates earth from other plants

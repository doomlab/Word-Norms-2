
a challenge between a group of competitors (footrace or car race) the winner usually will get something in the end either a prize trophy or bragging rights.human race is divided into different races groups of people based on where their ancestors are from we tend to divide people by race such as asian african caucasian native americans and pacific islanders sometimes people will use different names for different races such as instead of african they will use the term black or instead of caucasian they will use the term white.race is often a negative concept and is often used in negative ways however it can be scientifically important such as in the use of medicine people that are of certain races have a higher or lower risk for certain conditions. as we come together in this modern age many people are marrying people of other races and having kids and so people can actually have multiple races given enough time and we will not be able to divide people by race because everyone will be of many races and there will only be the human race.

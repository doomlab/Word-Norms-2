how often something happens 
often repeating events time 
a lot times 
how often something occurs in a given amount of time 
how many times: precise airwaves measurement in radio 
regularity 
the measure of time in which you perform the same action repeatedly 
"dial number of a radio/tv channel how often something happens the pitch/tone of a sound" 
how often one does something repeating an activity a way to measure time 
the rate something can be repeated over time 
number of occurrences in a given time how often something happens in music the number of sound waves which varies with pitch 
how often something occurs. has to do with time. 
how often how regularly 
rate of occurrence radio station numbers how close together a wave is 
often many hits variance 
radio frequency of events 
a measure of how often an event occurs 
how often sound waves timing 
happening over and over how fast or slow something moves 
how often something occur quickness a pattern 
mode rate rhythm 
wave vibrations 
the interval in which something occurs airwaves numbers on a radio dial 
"is how often something reoccurs is used in many different sciences is very important to mathematics" 
how often it happens interval of occurrence space between radio waves 
"has multiple meanings the first being the rate at which something occurs alternatively frequency is sound the highness or lowness of various sounds" 
how often an object passes a certain point over a certain amount of time is inversely proportional to wavelength. 
the rate of recurrence of a vibration 
how often something occurs 
amount of time sound wave how often 
dealing with radio a radio channel

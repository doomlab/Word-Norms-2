a shuttle that goes into outer space flies 


is something attached to spaceships in order to give them the power to leave earth's escape velocity so that it can travel outside of earth's orbit. 
source of power used to propel an object upward space 
moves fast uses fuel carries loads hard to control could blow up spews fire for locomotion usually metal sometimes plastic sometimes wood usually aerodynamic 
used by nasa big made out of metal goes into outer space astronauts fly it controlled by many different people

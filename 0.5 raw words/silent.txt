the lack of noise the act of being quiet 
quiet no sound noiseless 
hill quiet late night 
hear nothing quiet stillness emptiness 
not making any noise quiet not speaking mute still noiseless 
quiet still serene 
quiet no noise mute no sound 
peace quiet 
to not make noise to be quiet 
quiet peaceful not noisy not talking 
quiet without noise eerie speechless 
night no noise part of a famous christmas song 
no noise being completely quiet 
very quiet still without a sound 
quiet lack of noise peaceful 
no noise quiet 
quiet dummied up faint 
quiet tranquil without sound not speaking up staying out of it 
to hear nothing quiet 
quiet 
laconic mousy mum mute muted 
no words no sound 
quiet without sound mute 
mute 
quiet silence 
hush faint mum mute muted laconic close 
no volume 
quiet no noise calm 
is quiet is calm brings peace some monks are this 
not making or accompanied by any sound
